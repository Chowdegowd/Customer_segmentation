Introduction
Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing and business analytics. By identifying different customer segments, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts to better meet the needs and preferences of each group. In this project, we use K-Means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique, to group customers based on their attributes.

Dataset
The customer dataset used in this project contains various attributes of customers, such as sex, marital status, age, education, income, occupation, and settlement size. The dataset has been preprocessed and analyzed to understand the relationships between different variables.

Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git
cd customer-segmentation
Install the required dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb to go through the data preprocessing, analysis, clustering, and visualization steps.

Review the generated insights, visualizations, and customer segments to gain a better understanding of the dataset.
